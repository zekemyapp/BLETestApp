# BLE Test App
## SimpleBLEPeripheral Test App

This application searches for BLE Devices using the SimplePeripheral demo app from the TI CC26XX Chip
The source code of this application can be found [here](https://github.com/zekemyapp/Simple_Peripheral_CC26xx_CustomBoard)

## IMPORTANT
You are free to use this code at your own risk. Be aware that it was written with the sole purpose of testing the functionality of the TICC26XX Chip, therefore no other usage is warrantied. Expect to find many bugs a couple of null exceptions. Notably, **avoid clicking on any button if you are not connected
to a device and/or haven't clicked on a characteristic**.

I don't plan to support this app since a proper code made by the Android project already exist [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth-le)
